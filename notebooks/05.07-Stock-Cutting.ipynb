Examples of the one dimensional problem include cutting lengths of steel bar into a set of products, cutting wide paper rolls into smaller ones, and cutting dimensioned lumber to meet the production needs of furniture shops.\n","\n","In large scale applications the stock cutting problem begins with a base set of cutting patterns. Each cutting pattern breaks a piece of stock into a set of products. The base calculation is to find a mix of cutting patterns to meet product requirements. A secondary problem is solved to find additional cutting patterns with the potential to reduce costs. The solution then proceeds iteratively with new patterns are generated 'on the fly' coupled with a branch and bound search to find an optimal solution. This approach is called 'column generation.'\n","\n","As demonstrated below, for small scale problems the stock cutting problem can be formulated as an assignment of product pieces to stock pieces. For this example the data consists of a list of product types, lengths and demand. The example incorporates multiple types of raw materials. The objective is to maximize the number of pieces of stock material that are left uncut.\n","\n","An aspect of this problem is the high degree of solution symmetry. The number of equivalent solutions is a combinatorial function of the number of identical pieces of raw of materials. In these cases a solver may quickly find a solution but then need to search many equivalent solutions to verify optimality. This example uses a weighted objective to separate otherwise equivalent solutions.\n","\n","To repeat, this approach will not work for larger problems due to the excessive number of binary variables required and high degree of solution symmetry. Consult the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/cspsol/\">cspsol project</a> for a solution method using column generation and glpk api."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GTbuaqp_PE5f","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!apt-get install glpk-utils -qq"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"pycharm":{},"id":"TX869yDlOZ_z","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"c92531af-37af-4894-a8a5-491ba04ac180","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557198164271,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3657,"user":{"displayName":"Jeffrey Kantor","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8zK5aAW5RMQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKB0/kssUQyz8DTQ/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09038942003589296665"}}},"source":["%%writefile input.dat\n","\n","data;\n","\n","param bigM := 20;\n","\n","param: PRODUCTS: pLength demand :=\n","        '7m'        7        3\n","        '6m'        6        2\n","        '4m'        4        6\n","        '3m'        3        1 ;\n","  \n","param: RAWMATERIALS: rLength avail := \n","       '15m'       15        3\n","       '10m'       10        3 ;\n","  \n","end;"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Overwriting input.dat\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"pycharm":{},"id":"UXwWUUDFOZ_3","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":850},"outputId":"9ebdcba1-ed93-4987-d198-5c5af2f8c5d0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557198165162,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4531,"user":{"displayName":"Jeffrey Kantor","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8zK5aAW5RMQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKB0/kssUQyz8DTQ/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09038942003589296665"}}},"source":["%%script glpsol -m /dev/stdin -d input.dat -y output.txt\n","\n","# Stock Cutting Problem\n","\n","# Products\n","set PRODUCTS;\n","param pLength{PRODUCTS};\n","param demand{PRODUCTS};\n","\n","# Raw Materials\n","set RAWMATERIALS;\n","param rLength{RAWMATERIALS};\n","param avail{RAWMATERIALS};\n","\n","# Big M should be greater than the length of any stock piece\n","param bigM;\n","check {r in RAWMATERIALS} : bigM > rLength[r];\n","\n","# Create indexed sets enumerating all production pieces\n","set Q{p in PRODUCTS} := 1..demand[p] ;\n","\n","# Create indexed sets enumerating all raw material pieces\n","set S{r in RAWMATERIALS} := 1..avail[r];\n","\n","# y[p,q,r,s] = 1 assigns (product p, piece q) to (raw material r, piece s)\n","var y{p in PRODUCTS, q in Q[p], r in RAWMATERIALS, s in S[r]} binary;\n","\n","# u[r,s] = 1 indicates use of (raw material r, piece s)\n","var u{r in RAWMATERIALS, s in S[r]} binary;\n","\n","# w[r,s] is the remainder left over from (raw material r, piece s)\n","var w{r in RAWMATERIALS, s in S[r]} >= 0;\n","\n","# Assign product (p,q) only once to the set of all raw materials (r,s)\n","s.t.
