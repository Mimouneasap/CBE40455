    "A European option is the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a 'call') or to sell (a 'put') something at a specified price on a specified date in the future. An option to buy is a 'call' option, an option to sell is a 'put' option. Options come in many forms, ranging from private contracts between parties to exchange traded securities. Call and put options are frequently used in to manage the financial risk of processes exposed to the volatile commodity markets."
