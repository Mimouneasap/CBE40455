    "<p>\n",
    "    The stock cutting problem is to minimize the waste\n",
    "    associated with cutting up stock materials to produce a set of products. \n",
    "    Examples of the one dimensional problem include cutting lengths\n",
    "    of steel bar into a set of products, cutting wide paper rolls into smaller ones,\n",
    "    and cutting dimensioned lumber to meet the production\n",
    "    needs of furniture shops.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    In large scale applications the stock cutting problem begins with a\n",
    "    base set of cutting patterns. Each cutting pattern breaks a piece of stock into\n",
    "    a set of products. The base calculation is to find a mix of\n",
    "    cutting patterns to meet product requirements. A secondary problem is \n",
    "    solved to find additional cutting patterns with the potential to reduce\n",
    "    costs. The solution then proceeds iteratively with new patterns are \n",
    "    generated 'on the fly' coupled with a branch and bound search to find\n",
    "    an optimal solution. This approach is called 'column generation.'\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    As demonstrated below, for small scale problems the stock cutting\n",
    "    problem can be formulated as an assignment of product pieces to stock pieces.\n",
    "    For this example the data consists of a list of product\n",
    "    types, lengths and demand.\n",
    "    The example incorporates multiple types of raw materials. The objective\n",
    "    is to maximize the number of pieces of stock material that are left uncut.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    An aspect of this problem is the high degree of solution \n",
    "    symmetry. The number of\n",
    "    equivalent solutions is a combinatorial function of the number of identical\n",
    "    pieces of raw of materials. In these cases a solver may quickly find a \n",
    "    solution but then need to search many equivalent solutions to verify\n",
    "    optimality. This example uses a weighted objective to \n",
    "    separate otherwise equivalent solutions.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    To repeat, this approach will not work for larger problems due to the \n",
    "    excessive number of binary variables required and high degree of solution \n",
    "    symmetry. Consult the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/cspsol/\">cspsol project</a> \n",
    "    for a solution method using column generation and glpk api.\n",
